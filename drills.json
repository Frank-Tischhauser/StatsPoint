They play volleys. While doing so, each player moves from his side to the other. \n\nExample : If A starts on the left side and B on the right, then A moves to the right and B simultaneously to the left during the rally.

They all start on the service line. After the first hit the aim is to finish the point as soon as possible with a “decisive” volley, thus if all players are good, the average rally length should be short.\n\n Note : If you are only 2 players, do the same, but use only half of the service box."
