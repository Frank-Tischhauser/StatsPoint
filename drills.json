They play volleys. While doing so, each player moves from his side to the other. \n\nExample : If A starts on the left side and B on the right, then A moves to the right and B simultaneously to the left during the rally. Then A and B come back and repeat the pattern until there is a mistake.",

But they have no racquets and no balls, but only a heavy ball (2/3kg). The ball should be only thrown like a forehand : The player catches the ball and throw it by rotating his chest and doing a 'from bottom to top' movement, thus imitating a forehand. After every shot, the player gives a high five to his teammate. If the heavy ball bounces twice, outside the service box or goes into the net, the rally is finished.

Then they take the racquet but hold it with both hands with the same previous movement as if they were holding a pan. If they feel confident, they can then do it with only one hand (but hold the top of the racquet handle). Finally, if the feeling is good, they can hold the handle of the racquet normally.",
