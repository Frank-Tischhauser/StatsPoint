            """Goal : Improve footwork, volley accuracy and mental focus.\n\n Description : this exercise is about cooperation and footwork. A and B stand diagonally on the service line. They play volleys. While doing so, each player moves from his side to the other. \n\nExample : If A starts on the left side and B on the right, then A moves to the right and B simultaneously to the left during the rally. Then A and B come back and repeat the pattern until there is a mistake."""
